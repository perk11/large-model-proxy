Change counter to connection status?
Close connection when client connection is closed (php is killed. Maybe separate, compare to master)
Waiting connections number doesn't increment when waiting for resources (and during healthcheck?)
Not changing from waiting to resources to healthcheck?
Check resources after service is started (might be not needed, but looks better)
Tests
Readme changes

Add last resource check time to API?
